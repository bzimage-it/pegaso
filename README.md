# pegaso


Pegaso is my own code snippet and library for linux.
Different languages like bash, perl, etc... for doing all day work.

## Some directory explanation:

- **`lib`** : libraries
- **`snippets`** : code snipped, not to be used directly, but copied &amp modified
- **`t`**  : tests
- **`to_be_managed`** : contains stuff still needed to be arranged or put in right place, test to be written
